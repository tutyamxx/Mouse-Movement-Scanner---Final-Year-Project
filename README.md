# Mouse-Movement-Scanner - Final-Year-Project in C#

* This was my Final Year Project for University of Huddersfield 2017. On this piece of software I have done my dissertation and I got my Bachelor Honoured Degree.

* Software created to protect unattended computers that are not password locked while owner is away (Prevents data loss, stealing, hijacking) - Basically, it detects any mouse movement or keyboard press and locks down the computer :)


* Project is 100% free with no ads - Feel free to use it, mod it, compile it as long as you provide credits for it.
* Library used is entirely open-source and you can download it here:

          - https://globalmousekeyhook.codeplex.com/
          - https://github.com/gmamaladze/globalmousekeyhook
   
   
   
* I have really enjoyed building this piece of software so I have commented almost every line of code for you, the developer or whoever is checking this repository, to understand better. Good Luck !
